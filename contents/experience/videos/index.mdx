## Fighting misinformation in HVAC

I participated in the *[ASHRAE Talks "En Español" Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76WMfIPPAJVSrvfx2mZzAD?si=QG5S3hrZTly42S6oLDmEZg)* where I discussed the implications of misinformation in HVAC topics and why it is so important to fight against it. I made special emphasis to combat fake information e.g., devices falsely advertised as the latest air filtration technology against COVID or COVID-free fake certifications. I also promoted the usage of trustworthy sites such as the latest recommendations published by ASHRAE and CDC.

## Energy Efficiency in Buildings

In this *Gigantes de la Construcción* podcast episode I talked about the energy efficiency in buildings and about the recommended strategies to ensure indoor air quality during the COVID-19 pandemics.

## How much energy is consumed while you are choosing your favorite frozen product?
We are not always conscious about the energy consumption behind our choices. In this video I explain how many kWh are consumed for every minute that you leave a freezer door open at the supermarket.

## Is it possible to scape through a ventilation duct?
In this video I analyze whether John McClane could have scaped through the ventilation ducts of the Nakatomi Plaza building (Die Hard). I go over an engineering analysis using ASHRAE Fundamentals 2009 and determine the air flowing through a duct with the appropriate size. We calculate the equipment capacity (TR) and analyze the different common systems in high rise buildings while going over some energy efficiency remarks.
